1. Reflect on the differences between static and interactive visualizations.
Static and interactive visualizations both help us understand data, but they work in different ways. 
Static visualizations are quick to create and easy to read. They show a fixed view of the data and are great for presentations. 
However, they don’t allow any interaction — what you see is what you get. On the other hand, interactive visualizations let users explore the data themselves. 
You can hover over points to see details, filter results, zoom in on certain areas, or change the view entirely. 
This makes interactive visuals more powerful for deeper analysis and storytelling, especially with large or complex datasets. 
While static visuals are often simpler and faster to load, interactive ones offer a more dynamic and engaging experience for the audience.

2. Write a short paragraph discussing the advantages of using dashboards for real-time data exploration.
Dashboards are useful because they show important information all in one place and update it in real time. 
This helps people quickly see what’s going well and what needs attention. Instead of looking through a lot of data, users can easily understand the big picture and make decisions faster. 
Dashboards are also interactive, so you can click, filter, and explore the data in a way that’s easy to understand.


3. Explain how interactive tools like Plotly and Dash can improve data communication in professional settings.
Overall, tools like Plotly and Dash help turn complex data into easy-to-understand visual stories.
Instead of showing static charts, these tools let users explore the data by zooming in, filtering, or selecting specific values. 
This helps different team members understand the data better and ask questions in real time. 
It also makes presentations more engaging and clear, especially when explaining trends or patterns.
